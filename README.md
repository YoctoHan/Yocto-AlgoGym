* Immediate Feedback: Quick validation of solution correctness through the integrated testing framework
* Performance Analysis: Basic analysis of time and space complexity for implemented algorithms
* Progressive Learning: Difficulty gradient from fundamental to advanced problems
* Code Quality Assurance: Integration of code formatting and static analysis tools
## Technology Stack
* C++17/20 core language implementation
* GoogleTest testing framework
* CMake build system
* clang-format for code style consistency
* Git version control
* Project Structure

## Usage
1. Adding a New Problem: Create a new test file in the appropriate category under tests/
2. Implementing Solutions: Develop algorithm logic according to test requirements
3. Running Tests:
```bash
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./run_tests
```
4. Optimizing Solutions: Improve algorithms based on test results and performance analysis
## Learning Value
* Systematic mastery of classic algorithms and data structures
* Development of complex problem-solving mindset
* Enhancement of code design and implementation skills
* Preparation for technical interviews
* Building a personal knowledge base of algorithmic solutions
## Future Plans
* Add automatic algorithm complexity analysis
* Integrate performance benchmarking
* Implement algorithm visualization components
* Expand into more advanced algorithm domains (e.g., basic machine learning algorithms)
* Develop automatic synchronization with LeetCode/HackerRank problem libraries
